# Dodge
The rules are simple: dodge unless you don't have to ...

## Installation
To install the game locally clone the repo

```
git clone *insert url* 
```

I kinda assume you have [node](https://nodejs.org/) installed. 
To run the game: 
```
npm start
```

If you change anything within the ```/src``` code, webpack will notice it and will recompile the code & restart the server for you. 

Installation complete ðŸ”¥!

## UML
This is an overview of what the game looks like:

## Design Patterns
This repo is part of the course `CMGTPRG-08`. One of the challenges was to include certain design patterns into the game. 

### Singleton
*GameObject*

### Polymorphism
*Updating gameobjects in gameloop*

### Strategy
*being able to move the player y/n*
*screen state*

### Observer
*level change (faster moving gameobjects)*

## Gameplay components
The coolest thing about this course is that you are allowed to make anything you want. Some extra's are rewards so here is the stuff that makes this game really cool ðŸ˜¸.

### Canvas 
Even though I do use DOM elements for the menus, the actual game is build inside of a canvas. 

### External library: Three.js
I've used Three.js, an external library that makes it easier to work with WebGL, to create the game in 3D.
